### 👨🏻‍💻  About Me
* 💡  I deeply believe that learning new skills and applying these to real world situations is one of the biggest gifts life gave us.  
* 🎓 I'm currently studying one of my newest discoveries besides IT, the financial markets and how to apply trading algorithms efficiently.  
* 🌱 Concerning IT, I'm on track for learning more about all topics that are useful on my way. Almost every IT related subject is exciting for me. It's my big passion.  
* 📫 Feel free to send me a message via LinkedIn :)

### 🛠️ Tech stack
| 🧱 Area |  🖥️ Main Technologies I use  | :fire: Cherry picked favorite (sub-)frameworks/tools |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Software architecture**  | Domain Driven Design, Microservice/SCS-Systems, Software Design Patterns &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | My favorite SW patterns: MVP-Passive View, Repository Pattern |
| **Frontend development**  | HTML/JavaScript: React, NextJS, Vercel <br /> Style: TailwindCSS, Sass, Bootstrap | Definitely React-Query for distinguishing between remote and local state of an UI |
| **Backend development**  | Java: Spring, Quarkus <br /> C#: Asp.Net5+ <br /> Typescript: NestJS, mercurius <br /> Python: FastAPI, Flask | I really like the universal E2E + load testing tool JMeter
| **Data engineering/analytics**  | Relational DBs: PlanetScale (MySQL), PostgreSQL <br /> NoSQL: MongoDB <br /> Search Engine/Analytics: ElasticSearch, Clickhouse <br /> Deep Storage: S3 <br /> Data Streaming: Kafka, Google PubSub <br /> Big Data Processing: Google cloud functions, Spark, Dask <br /> Notebooks/Dashboards: Jupyter, Pandas, streamlit | For data discovery: Streamlit. Google PubSub / Google cloud functions are very nice to working with. Nvidia Rapids is the best approach for data processing at scale for the future (but too early stage atm)|
| **Machine Learning**  | Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Spacy, AX | I am quite impressed from the math behind machine learing algorithms. I've often used highly specialized ML tools so far instead of the mainstream ML tools. |
| **Infrastructure and Cloud**  | Clouds: Hetzner Cloud, Google Cloud, AWS, Vultr <br /> Cloud Native: Kubernetes, Helm, Docker <br /> CDNs: Vercel, Cloudflare, Google CDN <br /> Provisioning: Terraform, Ansible, Bash | I highly enjoying to work with Hetzner Cloud provisioned by Terraform Cloud. Kubernetes/Docker was a game changer! |
| **Monitoring/Logs**  | Metrics: Prometheus <br /> Logs: ELK-Stack <br /> Tracing: Jaeger <br /> Visualization: Grafana <br /> ... or Google Operations Suite at Google Cloud | I really like the Prometheus integration of Grafana |
| **Algotrading**  | C#: Ninjatrader, MultiCharts <br /> Python: IB-API | Ah. Frustrading area concerning good working tools. Ninjatrader is the best compromise. |
| **APIs**  | REST <br/>GraphQL  | Swagger for REST and graphql-codegen are great tools for contract driven developement |
| **Favorit editors**  | Visual Studio Code, Rider  | Rider for C# saved my life in Algotrading projects|
| **IOT**  | RaspberryPi  | OpenCV (Python version) for image recognition is very nice to program with |

<!---
| **Blockchain**  | ETH contracts  | |
| **IT-Security**  | Kali Linux + Tools  | |
