## About

### 👨🏻‍💻  About Me
* 💡  I deeply believe that learning new skills and applying these to real world situations is one of the biggest gifts life gave us.  
* 🌱 I'm currently studying one of my newest discoveries besides IT, the financial markets and how to apply trading algorithms efficiently.  
* 🎓 Concerning IT, I'm on track for learning more about all topics that are useful on my way. Almost every IT related subject is exciting for me. It's my big passion.  
* ✍️ In my free time, I publish some code on Github and some articles on Medium where I think also could be beneficial for others.  
* ⚡ Fun fact: I've always regretted that I haven't started earlier to publish code and thoughts about my work. Now, almost 20 years after I started with my first professional job in IT, I will give it a try. It's never too late in life ;)  
* 📫 Feel free to send me a message via LinkedIn :)

### 🛠️ Tech stack
| 🧱 Area |  🖥️ Main Technologies I use  | :fire: Cherry picked favorite (sub-)frameworks/tools |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Software architecture**  | Domain Driven Design, Microservice/SCS-Systems, Software Design Patterns &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | My favorite SW pattern: MVP-Passive View |
| **Frontend development**  | JavaScript: React <br /> HTML: Bootstrap <br /> CSS: Sass | Definitely Redux for structuring the state within an UI |
| **Backend development**  | Java: Spring, Quarkus <br /> C#: Asp.Net5+ <br /> Python: FastAPI, Flask | I really like the unversal E2E + load testing tool JMeter and Swagger for visualizing REST APIs
| **Data engineering/analytics**  | Relational DBs: PostgreSQL <br /> Search Engine/Analytics: ElasticSearch <br /> Deep Storage: S3 <br /> Data Streaming: Kafka <br /> Big Data Processing: Spark, Dask <br /> Notebooks: Jupyter, Pandas | ksql (Kafka) within bigger enterprise environments.  For data discovery: Jupyter notebooks in pycharm. Nvidia Rapids is the best approach for data processing (but too early stage atm)|
| **Machine Learning**  | Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Spacy, AX | I am quite impressed from the math behind machine learing algorithms. I've often used highly specialized ML tools so far instead of the mainstream ML tools. |
| **Infrastructure and Cloud**  | Clouds: Hetzner Cloud, AWS, Azure, Vultr <br /> Cloud Native: Kubernetes, Helm, Docker <br /> CDNs: Vercel, Cloudflare <br /> Provisioning: Terraform, Ansible, Bash | I highly enjoying to work with Hetzner Cloud provisioned by Ansible or Terraform. Kubernetes/Docker was a game changer! |
| **Monitoring/Logs**  | Metrics: Prometheus, Logs: ELK-Stack <br /> Visualization: Grafana  | I really like the Prometheus integration of Grafana |
| **Algotrading**  | C#: Ninjatrader, MultiCharts <br /> Python: IB-API | Ah. Frustrading area concerning good working tools. Ninjatrader is the best compromise. |
| **IOT**  | RaspberryPi  | OpenCV (Python version) for image recognition is very nice to program with |
| **Favorit editors**  | All JetBrains products, Visual Studio Code  | Rider for C# saved my life in Algotrading projects|

<!---
| **Blockchain**  | ETH contracts  | |
| **IT-Security**  | Kali Linux + Tools  | |
