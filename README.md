### Hi there 👋, I'm Bernhard


## 👨🏻‍💻  About Me
💡  I deeply believe that learning new skills and applying these to real world situations is one of the biggest gifts life gave us.
🌱 I'm currently studying one of my newest discoveries besides IT, the financial markets and how to apply trading algorithms efficiently.
🎓 Concerning IT, I'm on track for learning more about all topics that are useful on my way. Almost every IT related subject is exciting for me. It's my big passion.
✍️ In my free time, I publish some code on Github and some articles on Medium where I think also could be beneficial for others.
⚡ Fun fact: I've always regretted that I haven't started earlier to publish code and thoughts about my work. Now, almost 20 years after I started with my first professional job in IT, I will give it a try. It's never too late in life ;)
📫 Feel free to send me a message via LinkedIn :)
